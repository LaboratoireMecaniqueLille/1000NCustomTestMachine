"""
This example demonstrates how to move the motor after hitting a switch.
It also shows the use of Crappy Blocks outside a Crappy loop.

In this example, a Tkinter slider controlled by the user sends command to the
Actuator Block. The slider sends speed command to drive the motor here.
The user can only drive the motor in the opposite direction of the switch that
has been hit.

The test ends when the slider window is closed.
