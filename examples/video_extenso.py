"""
This example demonstrates the use of the VideoExtenso Block.

This Block computes the strain on acquired images by tracking the displacement
of several spots. It outputs the computed strain as well as the position and
displacement of the spots.

In this example, the level of strain is controlled by a Generator Block that
sends command to the Machine Block. This Machine Block drives the motor in
speed here. The VideoExtenso Block calculates the strain on the images, and
outputs it to a Grapher Block for display and to a Recorder Block for save.
The InOut Block measured the force applied, and also outputs it to a Grapher
Block and to a Recorder Block.

After starting this script, you have to select the spots to track in the
configuration window by left-clicking and dragging. Then, close the
configuration window and watch the strain be calculated in real time.
You can hit CTRL+C to stop it, but it is not a clean way to stop Crappy.
