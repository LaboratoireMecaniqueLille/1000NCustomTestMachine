"""
This example can be used to protect your sample during the tightening of the
sample to the machine.

In this example, the motor is driven in function of the level of stress in the
sample. This Machine Block drives the motor in speed here.
The InOut Block measured the force applied, and also outputs it to a Grapher
Block and to a Recorder Block.

You can hit CTRL+C to stop it, but it is not a clean way to stop Crappy.
