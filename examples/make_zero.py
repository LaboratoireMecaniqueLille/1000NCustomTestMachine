"""
This example can be used to set the extremity of the tensile bench as a
reference position in order to drive the motor later in absolute mode.
Moreover, it can be used to acquire the evolution the stress due to the screw
rotation in function of the position of the motor. This same stress could then
be offset from the real stress measured during the tensile test.

In this example, the motor will hit twice the extremity of the bench,
identified by an increase of the stress. Then, the motor will travel all along
the bench and record the force from the screw rotation at the same time.

You can hit CTRL+C to stop it, but it is not a clean way to stop Crappy.
