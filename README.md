# 1000NCustomTestMachine
This repository contains Python code for driving a 1000N test machine developed
at the LaMcube laboratory. 

Presentation 
------------

This machine is based on [Phidgets](https://www.phidgets.com/) hardware and on 
the python module [Crappy](https://crappy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
to perform different tests as tensile test, flexion test, compression test and 
compact tension test on different materials.

Phidgets
--------

Phidgets are a range of modular sensors and actuators designed to simplify the 
interaction between computers and the physical world. Their operation is based 
on a plug-and-play concept, allowing users to easily connect sensors and 
actuators to their computer using Phidgets hardware.

Crappy
------

The test with this machine can be performed with Crappy. Crappy is a Python 
module that aims to provide easy-to-use and open-source tools for command and 
data acquisition on complex experimental setups. It is designed to let users 
drive most setups in less than 100 lines of code. 

Requirements
------------

In order to use this machine and perform test, the user has then to install 
Crappy and several Phidgets library.

You'll find more details in the dedicated installation section of the 
documentation to install these different python module.

Documentation
-------------

The latest version of the documentation can be accessed on the [project's 
website](https://laboratoiremecaniquelille.github.io/1000NCustomTestMachine/). 
It contains information about the installation of the different python module,
a more detailed description of the hardware, descriptions of the setups to 
perform the different test and indications how to use crappy-based algorithms.
